<p><b>How to start:</b> Enter the configurations to determine<br/>
how many players (1-6), dice (5-10), sides (5-9), amount of<br/>
points needed to win (7,000-20,000) you want to play with,<br/>
and the 2 dice that you want to be worth points.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Your turn:</b> An amount of dice per turn has already<br/>
been determined. Roll all dice and set aside any dice that<br/>
are worth points (see scoring). You MUST set aside all dice at<br/>
the end of your turn to receive points. On each roll, set aside<br/>
the dice worth points. If you are able to set aside all the dice,<br/>
you bank those points and get all the dice back for a chance to<br/>
bank more. However, if you get to a point where nothing can be<br/>
set aside on you roll, it’s the next player’s turn. You only get<br/>
to keep the points that you were able to bank by setting ALL dice<br/>
aside. If you were not able to bank all dice, you get no points.</p>
<br/>
